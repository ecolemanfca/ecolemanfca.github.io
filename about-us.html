Argh!(singing) Go Johnny go, go, go; Johnny B Goode. (1985 Marty hums along for a few moments, realizing that he’s not half bad, then sees Biff's gang again. They are on the side platform, with weapons, waiting for 1955 Marty to finish so they can beat him up. 1985 Marty spots sandbags above Biff's gang. He climbs the rigging above the stage and slowly crawls across it. We see a view of 1955 Marty playing his guitar solo with 1985 Marty, almost hidden, climbing along the top. He is unseen.

They fall unconscious. 1955 Marty goes a bit overboard, and by the time he's finished playing some rock music, the dance is silent, looking at him. 1985 Marty climbs down. 1955 Marty looks at the crowd. Strickland is covering his ears.) I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.I wonder where we live, I bet its a big house, with lots of kids. How many kids... (Doc gets out a gadget and shines it on Jennifer. She falls back, unconscious.) Doc, what the hell are you doing? Relax Marty, it's a sleep-induced alpha-rhythm generator. She was asking too many questions and no-one should know too much about their future. Then what did you bring her for?(Doc freaks out again, and starts screaming. He trips over the hoverboard trying to get away from Marty and bumps into the piano and ends up sitting on the keys.) Doc, calm down, OK? Just calm down, it's me, it's Marty.</p>
