            <p><span class="lorem-ipsum text-warning"></span> 
                My dream has always been to bake cakes and cupcakes that will bring joy to people. Ever since I was a little kid, I have always wanted to become a baker. I would always be in the kitchen trying to find a new recepie to try. My parents finally decided to take me to a baking class, and I absolutely loved it! I kept going to the class every week. I then went to The Culinary Institution of America. I majored in baking and fine pastries. Soon after graduating, I set out to find a job. I have worked at several other bakeries, but I always felt called to open my own bakery. There was always something I didn't like about the other bakeries I had worked at. A few years after I had graduated, I started planning my business. After about 8 years after I had graduated college, there was grand opening of The Cupcake Connection. Ever since then, we have been growing and expanding. </p>
